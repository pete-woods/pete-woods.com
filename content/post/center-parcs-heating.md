If you've ever stayed at Center Parcs, you'll probably have noticed that the heating is configured to drop down to 14 &deg;C every few hours.

During a warm summer this is probably fine. But if, like me, whenever you go away you encounter freak weather, you might want to change it.

You'll find that none of the buttons on the heating controller do anything, except for the up/down temperature buttons. Then even after you've adjusted the temperature to something reasonable, it'll reset during the night. The trick is to hold the 'i' button for around 7 seconds - this sets a temperature override for 9 hours.
