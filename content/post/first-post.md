I'm an IT consultant. I do my best to not be like a "typical" consultant, and really care about the code I create and the product I deliver to my customer. To do this I'm trying to drive the adoption of "Continuous Delivery" within my company. Basically we're talking about test driven development, test automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, continuos refactoring and all that sort of thing.

The point of this blog is to capture the things I learn as I'm doing my job - from techniques for making your code maintainable, to things I've had to overcome deploying software, through to dealing with people. Especially those resistant to change (both managers and developers).

I'll also include links to sites I think contain really good information.

Hopefully this isn't my one and only blog post! :)
